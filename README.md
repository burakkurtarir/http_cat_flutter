# http_cat_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is using [Http Cat API](https://http.cat). This is the funniest api i've ever used. Basically you send a status code and API returns you a cat image xd

## CI/CD

I've added very simple CI/CD configuration with CodeMagic. For more info you can look at the [CodeMagic for Flutter Apps](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/building-a-flutter-app/)
